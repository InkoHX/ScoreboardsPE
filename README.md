    - sidebar: the default scoreboard position (at the right of your screen).
    - list: above the player list.
    - belowname: below the name of the player (not implemented in 1.7.0.2 beta).

  This is the order in which your entries are classified.
    - 0: The score is from the smallest to the biggest
